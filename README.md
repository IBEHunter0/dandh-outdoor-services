# D&H Outdoor Services

Hey! We’re a small, young crew doing basic yard work and cleanups around Newmarket, ON. This repo has our site code and info about what we do.

## About Us

We focus on straightforward jobs that make a real difference without overcomplicating things. No contracts, no pressure, no upselling. Just hands-on work from a local crew.

- Mowing & raking
- Garage and shed cleanup
- Trimming bushes and bagging leaves
- Watering & weed pulling
- Backyard furniture cleanup

## How It Works

1. You text us what you need done.
2. We ask a few questions if needed.
3. We give you a rough price range.
4. We schedule a time that works.

Prices depend on yard size, work required, and time. If something ends up being more than expected, we’ll let you know first.
